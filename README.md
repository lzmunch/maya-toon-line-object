To use, download files to the `scripts/ folder` in your Maya project (not the one in `Documents/maya/`) and run the file `toonLineEditorScript/toonLineEditor` from the script editor. This is important since the main script needs to load the other files (`sortTool` and `doPaintEffectsToGeom_Custom`).
